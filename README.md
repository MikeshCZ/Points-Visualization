# Points-Visualization

Interactive 3D visualization tool for displaying points and their rotations in 3D space using Three.js.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Scene**: Rotate, pan, and zoom to explore your data
- **CSV Data Import**: Load point data with positions and rotations from CSV files
- **Rotation Visualization**: Display axes for each point showing their orientation
- **Bilingual Interface**: Switch between Czech (default) and English with a single click üá¨üáß/üá®üáø
- **Customizable Display**:
  - Adjust point size (5-50 pixels)
  - Configure axes size (10-200) and opacity (0-1)
  - Toggle individual axis visibility (X/Y/Z)
  - Flip individual axes by 180¬∞
- **Multiple Rotation Orders**: Support for XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX
- **Angle Units**: Switch between degrees and radians
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Choose your preferred color scheme
- **Pivot Point Selection**: Click on any point to make it the center of rotation
- **Label Display**: Show/hide point names
- **Smooth Animations**: Animated camera transitions and visual feedback

## Usage

1. Open `src/points-visualization.html` in a web browser
2. Click on the "Naƒç√≠st data" (Load Data) panel
3. Select a CSV file with your point data
4. Interact with the 3D scene using mouse controls

No installation, build process, or server required - just open the HTML file!

## CSV Format

The input CSV file must contain the following columns:

```
name,p_x,p_y,p_z,r_x,r_y,r_z
```

- `name` - Point name/label
- `p_x`, `p_y`, `p_z` - Position coordinates (X, Y, Z)
- `r_x`, `r_y`, `r_z` - Rotation angles (degrees by default, or radians if enabled in UI)

Example:

```csv
name,p_x,p_y,p_z,r_x,r_y,r_z
Bod 1,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Bod 2,0.0,10.0,0.0,90.0,0.0,0.0
Bod 3,0.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
```

See `example/example.csv` for a complete example.

## Controls
